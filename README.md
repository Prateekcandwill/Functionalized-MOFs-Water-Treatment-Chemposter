# Functionalized MOFs for Water Treatment

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Functionalized Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Water Treatment** project. This repository hosts the code and resources for the scientific poster and interactive website showcasing the use of MOFs for heavy metal removal from contaminated water.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of **functionalized MOFs** for the selective removal of heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, arsenic) from water. MOFs are porous nanomaterials with high surface areas and tunable pore sizes, making them ideal for water purification. Key features of this project include:

- **High Efficiency:** >99% removal of heavy metals.
- **Selectivity:** 95% selectivity for lead over calcium.
- **Reusability:** >90% efficiency over 10 cycles.
- **Cost Savings:** 40% cheaper than traditional methods like reverse osmosis.

## How to Use the Calculator

The **Interactive Calculator** allows users to estimate the amount of MOFs required, removal efficiency, and cost savings for water treatment. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Parameters:**  
   - Select the heavy metal (e.g., lead, mercury, arsenic).  
   - Enter the concentration (mg/L) and water volume (L).  

2. **Output Results:**  
   - MOFs required (g).  
   - Removal efficiency (%).  
   - Cost savings (₹).  

3. **Example Calculation:**  
   - Input: Lead concentration = 10 mg/L, Water volume = 1000 L.  
   - Output: MOFs required = 10 g, Removal efficiency = 99%, Cost = ₹80.
